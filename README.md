# RateMyCoOp – Northeastern Co-op Experience Review App

## Project Duration
Sep 2023 – Dec 2023

## Overview
RateMyCoOp is an innovative web application prototype developed to enable Northeastern University students to rate and review their co-op experiences. This high-fidelity prototype has been crafted following an extensive user-centered design process.

## Live Application (Prototype)

## Problem Statement
Northeastern students lack a dedicated platform to provide transparent feedback on their co-op experiences, which is essential for future co-op participants when making informed decisions.

## Solution Highlights
- **User-Centered Design**: Conducted 5+ user interviews to gather insights, shaping the feature set and design.
- **Feature Brainstorming**: Orchestrated a Google Jamboard session, resulting in 25+ feature ideas and 10 page layout concepts.
- **Rapid Prototyping**: Utilized Axure for fast-paced prototype development, transforming initial concepts into an interactive prototype in a 4-week sprint.
- **Usability Testing**: Performed thorough usability testing, achieving a 90.3% perceived usability score from evaluations with 10+ users.

## Technologies Used
- Axure RP
- Google Jamboard

## Prototype Development Process
1. **Ideation & Interviews**: Conducted initial discussions with target users to capture their needs.
2. **Brainstorming Session**: Leveraged Google Jamboard for collaborative feature and design brainstorming.
3. **Sketching & Prototyping**: Transitioned brainstormed ideas into sketched and low-fidelity prototypes.
4. **Interactive Prototyping**: Evolved prototypes into a medium-fidelity version using Axure, integrating continuous user feedback.
5. **Final Usability Testing**: Finalized the high-fidelity prototype and validated usability through testing with target users.
